/**
 * Idle homepage background: a 16:9 montage cut from the case-study footage and
 * stills. It plays through once and then fades to the black it sits on, so the
 * page settles instead of cycling behind the work. Stays mounted while a
 * project is hovered — only its opacity changes — so it keeps its place rather
 * than restarting. A refresh or a return to the homepage remounts this
 * component, which is what plays it again.
 *
 * `onFinished` fires once, and is the homepage's cue to start its idle
 * showreel. It means "the montage is over" in the broad sense: it also fires
 * when there was never a montage to wait for — reduced motion, a rejected
 * autoplay, a video that failed to load — because a gate that only opened on a
 * clean playthrough would leave those visitors on a page that never moves.
