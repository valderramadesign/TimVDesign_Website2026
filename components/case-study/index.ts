/**
 * Reusable case study building blocks.
 *
 * Every block is optional and independently composable: a page imports the two
 * or three it needs and composes them in whatever order its story requires.
 * There is deliberately no component that renders a whole case study, and no
 * fixed section sequence anywhere in this folder — the outline lives on the
 * page, not in the system.
 *
 * Shared wrapper behaviour (element, spacing, scroll reveal, heading level,
 * heading styling, accessible name) lives once in `CaseStudySection`; the other
 * blocks compose it rather than repeating it.
 *
 * Project facts come from `lib/content.ts`. Narrative content is passed in by
 * the page. Neither is stored here.
